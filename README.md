The late 2019 outbreak of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) had an indelible imprint on the humanity. The world is recovering from the outbreak but there is danger of a second wave of the outbreak. To get rid of the outbreak it is necessary to contain the viral transmission and it is need of the hour to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public areas. The governments are providing strict guidelines to wear masks in public places. It is not manually feasible to check if people are wearing masks or not. In this paper, process of detecting face masks in public places is automated using Convolutional Neural Networks by performing comparative analysis on various CNN architectures. The face masks can be detected with the help of CCTV cameras, of those who are not following guidelines in public places. Such a system is very useful in post outbreak times and can be installed in public places such as Railway Stations, Airports, Parks, Schools, colleges, offices etc. to track and ensure wearing of masks by people.
